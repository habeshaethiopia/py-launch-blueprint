# Project Philosophy

The Py Launch Blueprint project is built on the following core principles:

## Simplicity

We believe in keeping things simple. Our goal is to provide a straightforward, easy-to-use template that helps developers get started quickly without unnecessary complexity.

## Best Practices

We adhere to industry best practices for Python development. This includes using modern tools and techniques to ensure code quality, maintainability, and scalability.

## Flexibility

While we provide a comprehensive template, we also recognize that every project is unique. Our template is designed to be flexible and easily customizable to meet the specific needs of different projects.

## Community

We value the contributions of our community. We encourage collaboration and welcome feedback to continuously improve the project.

## Documentation

We believe that good documentation is essential for any project. Our template includes detailed documentation to help developers understand and use the provided tools and configurations effectively.
