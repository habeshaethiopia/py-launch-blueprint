# GitHub Actions CI/CD Automation

GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD tool that allows you to automate your software development workflows directly in your GitHub repository. This guide will help you set up and configure GitHub Actions for your project.

## Getting Started

To get started with GitHub Actions, you need to create a workflow file in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository. Workflow files are written in YAML and define the steps to be executed when certain events occur in your repository.

### Example Workflow

Here is an example workflow file that runs tests and checks code quality on every push to the `main` branch:

```yaml
name: CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    name: continuous-integration
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.10", "3.11"]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Install uv
      uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5

    - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

    - name: Install the project
      run: uv sync --all-extras --dev

    - name: Run type checker
      run: uvx mypy py_launch_blueprint/

    - name: Check linters
      run: uvx ruff check py_launch_blueprint/
```

### Workflow Structure

A GitHub Actions workflow is composed of the following elements:

- `name`: The name of the workflow.
- `on`: The events that trigger the workflow. Common events include `push`, `pull_request`, and `schedule`.
- `jobs`: A list of jobs to be executed. Each job runs in a fresh virtual environment and can have multiple steps.
- `steps`: The individual steps to be executed within a job. Steps can include actions (reusable units of code) or shell commands.

### Common Actions

GitHub Actions provides a wide range of pre-built actions that you can use in your workflows. Some common actions include:

- `actions/checkout`: Checks out your repository so that the workflow can access the code.
- `actions/setup-python`: Sets up a specific version of Python.
- `actions/cache`: Caches dependencies to speed up workflow execution.
- `actions/upload-artifact`: Uploads build artifacts for later use.

### Custom Actions

In addition to using pre-built actions, you can also create your own custom actions. Custom actions are reusable units of code that can be shared across workflows and repositories. They can be written in JavaScript or as Docker containers.

## Best Practices

When using GitHub Actions, consider the following best practices:

- **Use Caching**: Cache dependencies to speed up workflow execution and reduce the load on external services.
- **Parallelize Jobs**: Use the `matrix` strategy to run jobs in parallel and reduce overall workflow execution time.
- **Use Secrets**: Store sensitive information, such as API keys and tokens, in GitHub Secrets and access them securely in your workflows.
- **Monitor Workflows**: Use the GitHub Actions UI to monitor workflow runs, view logs, and troubleshoot issues.
