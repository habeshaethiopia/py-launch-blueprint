# Type Checking with MyPy

Type checking is an essential part of maintaining a robust and error-free codebase. MyPy is a static type checker for Python that helps you ensure your code adheres to specified type annotations.

## Setting Up MyPy

To set up MyPy for your project, follow these steps:

1. **Install MyPy**:
   ```bash
   uv pip install mypy
   ```

2. **Configure MyPy**:
   Create a `mypy.ini` file in the root of your project with the following content:
   ```ini
   [mypy]
   python_version = 3.10
   strict = true
   ignore_missing_imports = false
   follow_imports = normal
   follow_imports_for_stubs = true
   disallow_any_generics = true
   disallow_subclassing_any = true
   disallow_untyped_calls = true
   disallow_untyped_defs = true
   disallow_incomplete_defs = true
   disallow_untyped_decorators = true
   no_implicit_optional = true
   strict_optional = true
   warn_redundant_casts = true
   warn_unused_ignores = true
   warn_no_return = true
   warn_return_any = true
   warn_unreachable = true
   pretty = true
   show_error_codes = true
   show_column_numbers = true
   ```

3. **Run MyPy**:
   To check your code with MyPy, run the following command:
   ```bash
   uvx --with-editable . mypy py_launch_blueprint/
   ```

## Best Practices for Type Checking

- **Annotate All Functions**: Ensure all functions have type annotations for their parameters and return types.
- **Use Type Hints**: Utilize Python's built-in type hints (e.g., `List`, `Dict`, `Optional`) to specify the expected types.
- **Avoid `Any`**: Minimize the use of the `Any` type to maintain strict type checking.
- **Leverage `TypedDict`**: Use `TypedDict` for dictionaries with a fixed set of keys and value types.
- **Check Third-Party Libraries**: Ensure third-party libraries used in your project have type stubs available.

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Missing Type Annotations**:
   - **Issue**: MyPy reports missing type annotations for functions.
   - **Solution**: Add type annotations to all function parameters and return types.

2. **Incompatible Types**:
   - **Issue**: MyPy reports incompatible types in assignments or function calls.
   - **Solution**: Ensure the types of variables and function arguments match the expected types.

3. **Ignoring Errors**:
   - **Issue**: MyPy reports errors that you want to ignore.
   - **Solution**: Use `# type: ignore` comments to suppress specific errors, but use them sparingly.

4. **Third-Party Libraries**:
   - **Issue**: MyPy reports missing type stubs for third-party libraries.
   - **Solution**: Install type stubs for the libraries using `uv pip install types-<library>`.

By following these best practices and addressing common issues, you can effectively use MyPy to maintain a type-safe and reliable codebase.
