# Development Workflow

This document outlines the development workflow for contributing to the Py Launch Blueprint project. Following this workflow ensures consistency and quality in the codebase.

## Branching Strategy

We use the Gitflow branching model to manage our development process. The main branches are:

- `main`: The production-ready branch. All releases are made from this branch.
- `develop`: The main development branch. All feature branches are merged into this branch.

### Feature Branches

Feature branches are used to develop new features or fix bugs. They are created from the `develop` branch and should be named using the following convention:

```
feature/<feature-name>
```

### Hotfix Branches

Hotfix branches are used to quickly fix critical issues in the `main` branch. They are created from the `main` branch and should be named using the following convention:

```
hotfix/<hotfix-name>
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a fork of the repository on GitHub.
2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
3. **Make Changes**: Make your changes in the new branch.
4. **Run Tests**: Ensure that all tests pass before submitting your changes.
5. **Commit Changes**: Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message.
6. **Push Changes**: Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
7. **Open a Pull Request**: Open a pull request on GitHub to merge your changes into the `develop` branch.

## Code Review

All pull requests must be reviewed and approved by at least one other contributor before being merged. The code review process helps maintain code quality and consistency.

### Review Checklist

- Ensure the code follows the project's coding style and conventions.
- Verify that all tests pass.
- Check for any potential security vulnerabilities.
- Ensure that the code is well-documented.
- Verify that the changes do not introduce any new issues.

## Merging Pull Requests

Once a pull request has been reviewed and approved, it can be merged into the `develop` branch. The `develop` branch is periodically merged into the `main` branch for releases.

## Release Process

1. **Prepare for Release**: Ensure that all changes in the `develop` branch are ready for release.
2. **Create a Release Branch**: Create a release branch from the `develop` branch.
3. **Test the Release**: Thoroughly test the release branch to ensure stability.
4. **Merge into `main`**: Once the release branch is stable, merge it into the `main` branch.
5. **Tag the Release**: Tag the release in Git with the version number.
6. **Deploy the Release**: Deploy the release to the production environment.

## Continuous Integration

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration (CI). The CI pipeline runs tests and checks code quality on every pull request and push to the `develop` and `main` branches.

### CI Configuration

The CI configuration is defined in the `.github/workflows` directory. The main CI workflow includes the following steps:

- **Install Dependencies**: Install project dependencies.
- **Run Linters**: Run code linters to check for style and quality issues.
- **Run Tests**: Run the test suite to ensure that all tests pass.
- **Build Documentation**: Build the project documentation.

## Conclusion

Following this development workflow helps ensure that the Py Launch Blueprint project remains consistent, maintainable, and of high quality. Thank you for contributing!
