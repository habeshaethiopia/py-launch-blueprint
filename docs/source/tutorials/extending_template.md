## Adding New Features

To add new features to the Py Launch Blueprint template, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Feature**: Determine the new feature you want to add and its requirements.
2. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-new-feature
   ```
3. **Implement the Feature**: Write the code for the new feature in the appropriate module.
4. **Write Tests**: Write tests to ensure the new feature works as expected.
5. **Update Documentation**: Update the documentation to include information about the new feature.
6. **Commit and Push**: Commit your changes and push the branch to the repository.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   git push origin add-new-feature
   ```

## Modifying Configurations

To modify the existing configurations in the Py Launch Blueprint template, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Configuration**: Determine the configuration you want to modify.
2. **Locate the Configuration File**: Find the configuration file in the project directory. Common configuration files include `pyproject.toml`, `mypy.ini`, and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
3. **Make Changes**: Edit the configuration file to make the necessary changes.
4. **Test Changes**: Test the changes to ensure they work as expected.
5. **Commit and Push**: Commit your changes and push the branch to the repository.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Modify configuration"
   git push origin modify-configuration
   ```

## Integrating Additional Tools

To integrate additional tools into the Py Launch Blueprint template, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Tool**: Determine the new tool you want to integrate and its requirements.
2. **Install the Tool**: Install the tool using the appropriate package manager.
   ```bash
   uv pip install <tool-name>
   ```
3. **Configure the Tool**: Add the necessary configuration for the tool in the appropriate configuration file.
4. **Test Integration**: Test the integration to ensure the tool works as expected.
5. **Update Documentation**: Update the documentation to include information about the new tool.
6. **Commit and Push**: Commit your changes and push the branch to the repository.
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Integrate new tool"
   git push origin integrate-new-tool
   ```

## Best Practices

When customizing the Py Launch Blueprint template, follow these best practices to ensure a smooth and maintainable process:

- **Keep Changes Modular**: Make changes in small, modular increments to make it easier to test and review.
- **Write Tests**: Always write tests for new features and configurations to ensure they work as expected.
- **Update Documentation**: Keep the documentation up-to-date with any changes you make to the template.
- **Follow Code Style Guidelines**: Adhere to the project's code style guidelines to maintain consistency.
- **Use Version Control**: Use version control to track changes and collaborate with others.

By following these best practices, you can effectively customize the Py Launch Blueprint template to fit your specific needs while maintaining a high level of code quality and consistency.
