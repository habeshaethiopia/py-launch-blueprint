# Contributor License Agreement (CLA) FAQ

## What is a Contributor License Agreement (CLA)?

A Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is a legal document in which you state that you are entitled to contribute the code you are submitting and that you grant us the rights to use that contribution.

## Why do I need to sign a CLA?

Signing a CLA helps protect both the contributors and the project maintainers. It ensures that all contributions are properly licensed and that contributors understand their rights.

## How do I sign the CLA?

We have integrated the CLA Assistant bot to streamline the CLA signing process. When you open a pull request, the bot will check if you have signed the CLA. If you have not, it will provide a link to sign it.

### Individual Contributors

If you are contributing as an individual, please sign the [Individual CLA](cla/individual_cla.md).

### Corporate Contributors

If you are contributing on behalf of a company, please sign the [Corporate CLA](cla/corporate_cla.md).

## What happens if I don't sign the CLA?

If you do not sign the CLA, we will not be able to accept your contributions. The CLA Assistant bot will notify you if you need to sign the CLA when you open a pull request.

## Do I need to sign the CLA for every contribution?

No, you only need to sign the CLA once. The CLA Assistant bot will remember that you have signed the CLA for future contributions.

## Can I withdraw my CLA?

Once you have signed the CLA, it is generally not possible to withdraw it. The rights granted to the project maintainers are perpetual and irrevocable.

## Who can I contact if I have questions about the CLA?

If you have any questions or concerns about the CLA, please open an issue on GitHub or reach out to the project maintainers.
